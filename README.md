# Starship CAD Project 🚀

This repository showcases a SolidWorks CAD project completed for **AME 5193: Intro to Computer-Aided Design (Spring 2025)**.  
The project involved designing and assembling a Starfleet-inspired starship from the ground up, with an emphasis on subsystem integration, parametric modeling, and presentation-quality visualization.
